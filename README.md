# NT.IPTV
IPTV Desktop App , stream, download 
The main purpose for this project is to have the ability to download a movie from IPTV. Then we decided to build a full IPTV.
The main IPTV we used to build and test this app is [lionz](https://tvlionz.com/)

You should have a subscription from Lionz IPTV to use this app (we will not provid it).
